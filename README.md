# Introduction: AgileGovernance Constitution

### What is the AgileGovernance Constitution?

The AgileGovernance Constitution documents the core rules, structure, and processes of the AgileGovernance “operating system” for governing and managing an organization. It provides the foundation for an organization wishing to use AgileGovernance, by anchoring the shift of power required in concrete and documented “rules of the game”, which everyone involved can rely upon.

### How is the AgileGovernance Constitution intended to be used?
The Constitution is intended to be referenced by whatever declaration or agreement captures the decision to organize using the AgileGovernance system. That may be a formal set of legal bylaws or similar operating agreement, or a simple board resolution or CEO policy declaration similar to the <a href="https://github.com/Spindle-Agile/AgileGovernance-Constitution/blob/default/Adoption%20Declaration%20Sample.pdf" target="_blank">sample one attached here</a>. See Article V for key adoption-related matters. Also note that this explanatory page and the sample declaration are included for informative purposes but are not part of the core Constitution document.

### What the AgileGovernance Constitution isn’t
The AgileGovernance Constitution is **not a complete set of legal bylaws or a formal operating agreement**. (Spindle separately publishes its own operating agreement as an example of a legal governing document that references and incorporates this Constitution.)

The Constitution is also **not an instruction manual or a guidebook** for learning to use the AgileGovernance system. Like the rulebook for a nuanced sport, it can serve as a critical reference at times, but reading it will not teach you how to play the game.
